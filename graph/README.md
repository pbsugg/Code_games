Graph-based implementation with basic traversals (depth-first and breadth-first search)

Additional challenges (109)

4.1 Given directed graph, find out whether there is a route between two nodes.  Output the route

4.2 Given a sorted array with unique integers, write algorithm to create a minimal-height binary search tree

4.4 Write function to check if binary tree is balanced. e.g., two subtrees never differ in height by more than 1

4.8  Write code to find the first common ancestor of two nodes in binary tree.  Avoid storing additional nodes in a data structure.
